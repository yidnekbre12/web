            </h1>
            <p class="fasil-text"> Fasilides was proclaimed emperor in 1630 during a revolt led by Sarsa Krestos,
                 but did not reach the throne until his father abdicated in 1632. Once he became emperor, Fasilides
                  immediately restored the official status of the traditional Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He sent for
                   a new abuna from the patriarch of Alexandria, restoring the ancient relationship that had been 
                   allowed to lapse. He confiscated the lands of the Jesuits at Dankaz and elsewhere in the empire 
                   and exiled them to Fremona. When he heard that the Portuguese bombarded Mombasa, Fasilides 
                   assumed that Afonso Mendes, the Roman Catholic prelate, was behind the act, and banished the 
                   remaining Jesuits from his lands. Mendes and most of his followers made their way back to Goa, 
                   being robbed or imprisoned several times on the way. In 1665, he ordered the "Books of the 
                   Franks"—the remaining religious writings of the Catholics—burnt

                <p class="minilik-text">Menelik II (Ge'ez: ዳግማዊ ምኒልክ dagmawi mənilək[nb 1]; horse name Abba Dagnew 
                    (Amharic: አባ ዳኘው abba daññäw); 17 August 1844 – 12 December 1913), baptised as Sahle Maryam 
                    (ሣህለ ማርያም sahlä maryam) was King of Shewa from 1866 to 1889 and Emperor of Ethiopia[nb 2] 
                    from 1889 to his death in 1913. At the height of his internal power and external prestige, 
                    the process of territorial expansion and creation of the modern empire-state was completed by 1898.[2]

                    The Ethiopian Empire was transformed under Emperor Menelik: the major signposts of modernisation
                     were put in place, with the assistance of key ministerial advisors. Externally, Menelik led Ethiopian
                      troops against Italian invaders in the First Italo-Ethiopian War; following a decisive victory at the 
                      Battle of Adwa, recognition of Ethiopia's independence by external powers was expressed in terms of 
                      diplomatic representation at his court and delineation of Ethiopia's boundaries with the adjacent 
                      kingdoms.[2] Menelik expanded his realm to the south and east, into Oromo, Kaffa, Sidama, Wolayta 
                      and other kingdoms or peoples.

                    Later in his reign, Menelik established the first Cabinet of Ministers to help in the administration of 
                    the Empire, appointing trusted and widely respected nobles and retainers to the first Ministries.[5] These 
                    ministers would remain in place long after his death, serving in their posts through the brief reign of 
                    Lij Iyasu (whom they helped depose) and into the reign of Empress Zewditu
